# RG-140 atomic dispatch boundary (design, not execution)

Status: proposed; based on draft #630 at e921dfe6ce8bf0b034ff4ce67fa2500b22cc59d2.
Issue #545 remains OPEN. This document does not authorize production execution.

## Observed contracts

- Migration 160's rg141_version, rg141_config_job and rg141_server call the
  reserved-node fence. It rejects INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE as applicable,
  including the version counter. An approval does not release that reservation.
- Migration 173 allocates immutable candidate/version and job UUIDs, not rows.
  Migration 174 records immutable human authorization, not a consumed dispatch.
- config_versions has UNIQUE(server_id, version). configs/repository.go locks
  the server, reads next_config_version and advances it in the insertion
  transaction. The new path must retain that serialization.
- config_apply_jobs.config_version_id is a foreign key. The old exact-ID test
  used the baseline version to isolate the job-ID fence. The added case uses
  BOTH proposed IDs and requires P0141, not a foreign-key error (23503).
- agents/repository.go ClaimNextConfigTask changes pending to in_progress;
  CompleteConfigTask changes the job again. Those writes also encounter rg141.
  A special INSERT exception alone cannot implement the lifecycle.
- The current claim RETURNING projection supplies rendered_config and
  config_hash but does not itself return request_payload. A marker stored only
  in request_payload cannot establish the Agent's scoped removal contract.
- install.sh configures routegate as database owner. There is no migration
  establishing a separate least-privilege dispatch executor. SECURITY DEFINER
  alone is not a security boundary against the same database owner.

## Minimum proposed transaction

1. Inspect and recompute the exact one-account removal candidate, then acquire
   server, preparation, Agent, human session and RBAC locks in the established
   order. Invoke validatePreparedRemovalDispatchLocked in the writer transaction.
   Re-read all mutable facts after waits; recheck the deadline at the final
   SQL write boundary. A successful earlier Check call is never authority.
2. Enter a dedicated SQL operation that consumes the bound human authorization
   once. Preserve the approval row as history; record consumption separately.
   Bind operation, actor/session, Agent generation, both UUIDs, both candidate
   hashes, original baseline and the exact next version number.
3. Insert the exact immutable candidate, advance the counter once and create
   the exact job in that same transaction. Any error rolls back all three
   effects and consumption. A repeat may read a matching receipt, but must
   never issue another job or silently regenerate IDs.
4. Preserve the node reservation through dispatch and evidence collection.
   Cancelling preparation or temporarily removing the fence to use ordinary
   Apply is not a permissible transition.
5. Keep executable rows unavailable to generic polling until the scoped claim,
   completion and Agent task contract are implemented. An implementation that
   emits a generic pending apply job before this boundary exists is incomplete.

## Unresolved implementation boundary

Before changing migration 160 guards, choose and test an unforgeable entry to
the dedicated SQL transition under the actual Manager database privileges.
Neither a caller-set GUC, knowledge of the UUIDs/nonce, an unrestricted
consumption-table INSERT nor pg_trigger_depth alone establishes this entry.

A dedicated executor role/function with protected consumption records is a
candidate, but requires explicit privilege provisioning, migration ownership,
REVOKE/GRANT and upgrade tests under a non-owner application role. Do not claim
that this separation already exists or apply it to production in this slice.
Alternatively, a constrained trigger transition needs an explicit threat
boundary and proof that direct SQL cannot manufacture its execution context.
This decision blocks a safe executable dispatch change; it does not justify
a broad bypass of P0141.

The claim/completion transitions must separately bind the original Agent
generation and operation, constrain changed columns and status edges, retain
ordinary Apply denial, and serialize consistently with server-first admission.
The deadline must be specified at each authority-consuming boundary; expired
human approval must not become a reusable execution lease.

## Required tests before enabling the writer

- Existing generic SQL cases keep returning P0141 with valid approval and
  exact IDs; complete durable rows remain unchanged after each rejection.
- Wrong actor/session/generation/nonce/hash/ID, expired approval and lock-wait
  invalidation fail without allocating rows or advancing the counter.
- Concurrent dispatch, retry after commit, and lost response create at most
  one version/job/consumption. Inject failures between each write and verify
  complete rollback, including the version counter.
- Generic claim/completion cannot execute or forge the scoped operation.
  A scoped claim returns the complete validated Agent removal contract.
- Disposable sing-box proves old UUID rejection, termination of its existing
  sessions, and another account's continued usability. Shared-process restart
  can interrupt both accounts; distinguish successful reconnection from
  uninterrupted existing sessions instead of claiming zero downtime.

PostgreSQL acceptance, HTTP receipt, IDs, and post-release evidence are not
proof of VPN access termination. No US/FI/RU activity or real credentials.
