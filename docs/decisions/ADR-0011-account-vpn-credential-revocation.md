# ADR-0011 — Subscription status is not verified VPN credential revocation

- **Status:** Proposed / design gate; no runtime revocation engine implemented.
- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Tracking:** [RG-140 credential revocation #545](https://github.com/ikaevus/RouteGate/issues/545);
  [subscription continuity #509](https://github.com/ikaevus/RouteGate/issues/509).

## Current confirmed behavior

1. `POST /devices/{deviceId}/revoke` and token rotation invalidate
   **subscription bearer links** only. Already imported VLESS/Reality, Hysteria2
   and other protocol credentials are not cleared from the VPN runtime.
2. `vpnaccounts.Repository.SetAccountStatus` updates a PostgreSQL account
   row (`status`, `updated_at`, `config_updated_at`). Public
   `/sub/<token>` immediately denies non-active accounts, **without**
   applying anything on the node. Bulk status updates have the same scope.
3. `DeleteAccount` deletes a database record; it does not prove the
   previously applied listener stopped accepting this account's credentials.
4. Re-activating a suspended/revoked account can allow a still-valid token
   to retrieve a subscription again. It is **not** a trustworthy way to
   restore a previously removed VPN runtime account.

Therefore the existing status badge `Suspended` or `Revoked` means **the
account record is in that lifecycle state**, not that VPN tunnels were
terminated. `Inactive` and `Expired` are not synonyms for
`verified blocked in VPN runtime`.

## First stage: truthful UI (separate PR)

- Explicit confirmations on suspend/revoke/delete, **including bulk**.
- Display the difference between blocked subscription retrieval and
  unverified runtime credential removal while account is suspended,
  revoked or expired. Show the existing Protocols/Apply section as the
  next place to inspect, **not** an auto-apply or a completed badge.
- Account status success response says *status changed* rather than
  *VPN access disabled*. Reactivation warns existing unexpired tokens
  can begin working again.
- No automatic cleanup, extra node operations, entitlement reissue,
  revocation of another device, or old-token redirects.

## Required future runtime operation (#545)

Suggested durable states:

```text
REQUESTED → PREFLIGHT → PREPARING → APPLYING → VERIFYING → CONFIRMED
                   ↘ BLOCKED / FAILED / RECOVERY_REQUIRED
```

Use a transactionally persisted operation with explicit actor, exact
account and source-node ID, pinned applied config version/hash, apply
job ID, protocol identity and timing information.

### Safety invariants

- **Scope:** one account, one eligible VPN/Hybrid node, initially applied
  VLESS/Reality. No assumptions about geographic direction, node name,
  443 vs 8443, or local version ordering. US Hybrid must retain Manager,
  HTTPS, Agent, and unrelated protocols.
- **Preflight:** reject stale/unknown applied snapshot, absent Agent,
  conflicting transfer, apply/maintenance reservation, or unrelated
  unapplied saved changes. Never deploy all saved edits merely to revoke
  this account.
- **Renderer:** construct a controlled config from the proven current
  applied baseline, removing **only** the selected account's specific
  deployed VLESS UUID while retaining all unrelated accounts and
  listeners. Apply must be version-pinned, validated and atomic.
- **Proof:** Agent-confirmed apply for expected version+hash, applied
  snapshot **absence** of revoked identity, unchanged membership for
  all unrelated users, runtime/listener checks, and protocol-specific
  analysis of pre-existing sessions. No `confirmed` on timeout, status
  update, heartbeat or HTTP 200 alone.
- **Failure:** if apply fails or proof is missing, the UI must say runtime
  state **unknown/pending**, retain the failed operation and guide
  explicit recovery. Restore of previous config may re-enable
  credentials and must never be silently automatic outside carefully
  designed bounded rollback semantics.
- **Concurrency:** protect target account/node from reactivation,
  deletion, transfers, fresh assignments or unrelated config applies
  while an operation is active; survive Manager restarts without
  replaying jobs.
- **Security/audit:** least privilege, scoped operator confirmation,
  no bearer links/private keys/UUIDs in logs, no raw shell input,
  no account tokens rotated by default.
- **Testing:** two-account protected baseline; one removed, one still
  served. Include failed apply, stale versions, Agent disconnect,
  competing changes, Manager restart, repeated requests, and existing
  client sessions in an isolated sing-box test before any live testing.

### Per-device limitation

Devices currently have **individual subscription URLs** but share
the VPN Account's protocol credential (e.g. VLESS UUID). Consequently,
device-token revocation must **not** be shown as disconnecting only that
device from the VPN. True device-level termination needs a separate
per-device VPN identity design and cannot be emulated by revoking the
shared account credential (which would disrupt other devices).

### Unsupported / shared-protocol caution

A node-wide MTProto secret or other shared credential cannot be
revoked for one user without impacting others. The future feature must
explicitly refuse unsupported modes, rather than overclaim isolation.

## Rollout boundaries

All of this ADR is **design**, not an executable revocation endpoint.
No production migrations, Agent restarts, token rotations, FI tests or
Manager updates are approved by this document. The first PR improves
only the warnings/status UX; follow-on backend work requires review
and isolated end-to-end validation.
